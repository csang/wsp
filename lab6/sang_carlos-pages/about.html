			<h2>About Us</h2>
		
			<p>The facility’s policy of free parking and free general admission will continue as long as the attractions remain on a pay as you go basis.
Our rides and attractions are priced below what you will find anywhere else. The park is kept as clean and safe as possible. You will always find an owner or manager on site working with the rest of the staff. We are home to over 70 staff members a season with 12 full and part time on a year round basis attending to Oasis events and preparing for the next season. Thunder Island has a few unique qualities such as generating its own power, a private facility for catered and special events that are not available to the public except on a reserved basis, and owners and managers always in charge and leading the way.</p>

			<p>Thunder Island provides visitors with great food! The Slider’s café is located near the Water Park and includes an air cooker to provide a healthier alternative to frying.</p>

			<p>Thunder Island includes The Oasis, a year-round catering facility and party house, that handles weddings, receptions, BBQs, company events, and they cater off site. It includes a beautiful 1200-square-foot glass room that makes a great venue for any occasion!</p>

			<p>Family owned and operated, Thunder Island is a wonderful, clean, safe environment for families to enjoy the summer weather, with free general admission, free parking, and no sales tax on All-Day Park Passes! The Perau family invites you to, "Come play!"</p>

			<p>Today's entertainment market is complex, and today's guests are busier. For 30 years Thunder Island has been here working to make people happy!  So take time out from the rest of the world and visit us. Whether it’s for a wedding reception, a go-kart ride, a game of mini-golf, a trip down a waterslide, or a company affair, we are trying all the time to make things as easy and pleasurable for you as possible.</p>
