			<h2>Extreme Body Sliding</h2>
			<img src="images/attractions/extreme_body_sliding.jpg" alt="image of the extreme body sliding" />
			<p>From Proslide Technology of Canada comes the most innovative body-sliding challenge -- only a few others like this are operational in the world today! If you're a seasoned body slider, come to Thunder Island!</p>

			<p>Your ride starts with a fast, heart-pounding trip down an enclosed tube. You shoot out of the dark tube into a stadium-like bowl on a sheen of water. There's no control as you rapidly swirl around and around, down, down toward the unavoidable hole at the bottom.</p>

			<p>Then you're propelled through the drain (Head first? Feet first? Sideways? You can't control yourself!), dropping through the air into 8-feet of water. Every ride is different!</p>

			<p>Thunder Rush is for swimmers only, must be at least 48" tall to ride!</p>
