			<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
			
			<p>Our targeted audience includes families and teenagers. When families are on vacations and have nothing else to do, they will search for parks and find this amazing water park to relax and have fun at the same time. And if they don't want water they can still ride go-karts and play mini-golf. Teenagers in high-school or college would love to have some fun and party at a water park whenever they have the time.</p>
